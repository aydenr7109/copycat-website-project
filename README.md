I did this project as i felt like it was a good test of my skills to see whether or not I could create a copy of a website. Based on the final design, it didn't necessarily came out like it was supposed to since I ran out of time due to work from other classes but I still say that it definitely looks similar to the orginal website of Deltamath. Useful things that I learned during this project was how to create textfields when creating survey type websites. Overall, if I had more time, this could be amazing but for what it is, it is not bad.
